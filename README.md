# About
Webscrapping project to use the [Megablast](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi??DATABASE=nr&PAGE=MegaBlas) and [Sequence Matcher](http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/seqmatch/) tools of NCBI and RDP, respectively.  
Here I make use of dataclasses and object-oriented programming (OOB) to make the code cleaner.  
Although the queries could be done directly through Python via existing APIs, I wanted to learn  
about webscrapping using Selenium ðŸ˜„.
